Crossing the cultural Rubicon

Looking for the data is difficult. Most people that I made contact with; someone from the University, a principal, and a child psychologist all have no idea what I am talking about. It is really hard to describe importing data sets when there is little context and this has really forced me to think about how to explain what I am doing. Finally I also realized that as an American (and someone that does not like writing) I get strait to the point to fast in my correspondences and probably come a cross as rude. 
This is a part of the learning process and I appreciate everyoneâ€™s patience as I fumble along.

Here is the first version of the map I will update as I work on styling.
