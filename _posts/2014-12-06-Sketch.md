The map

For this project I will create a map is a visualization to illustrate the overlapping needs with potential distribution partners. The distribution strategy will take in to account the following types of data

➢	Largest population of underperforming form one schools (elementary students)

➢	Large populations of children that do not have access to preschool

➢	Potential partnership networks already in place

     o	prenatal clinics/Health facilities
     
     o	Churches /NGOs

     o	Elementary schools 

     o	Open to suggestion if I have over looked a opportunity

I need the addresses for all of the above to make a visual for my final project. Here is a link to data I already sourced for this project,The problem with what I have is that most of it is 15 years old. The sample size is really limited so I’m not sure if it is accurate. Finally the locations of prenatal/Health clinics, relevant NGO’s, and Geographic population data had been really difficult to find. I have been franticly reach out to resources in Trinidad and I’m hoping for some advice soon…
