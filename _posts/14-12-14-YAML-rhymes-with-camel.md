YAML rhymes with camel
“Yaml array”
Until I figure out how to layer my map, I can’t see the png’s that I made for the road layer. Reading code feels like reading Doctor Suess it almost makes sense, but not really.

This is my code...
{source: "mapbox:///mapbox.mapbox-streets-v5,kstudio.d3253295"
layers:
  - road_label
  - landcover
  - country_label
  - water_label
  - water
  - TTO_adm1
