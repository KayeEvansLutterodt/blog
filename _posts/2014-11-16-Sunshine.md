“knowledge is light”
Sunshine is the beginning of a plan to try to transcend the limitations of parents abilities by introducing a product that reads books without the parent needing to know how to read. Also its presents is a physical reminder and prompter that reading is an important activity and should be done everyday (like the sun ☺).

Sunshine is a round toy that is the size of your palm one side will have solar panels and the reverse will have navigation (shaped like a sundial) to play 500 child friendly stories. The idea is that the parents play this once a day every day from infancy to 6 years old as a way to bridge the word gap from poor underprivileged children to their wealthier counterparts.
