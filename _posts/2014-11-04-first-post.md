It is an interesting challenge to flatten something that is round, the art of mapping, is restrictive in many ways. There are a number of visual signals that are used describe the area of various land masses, that it leaves few other visual tools to express other things. So one must be a bit more creative when adding layers of data to keep it understandable and beautiful.
 
“Truthyness”
Like photography maps feel like the truth but constantly express a limited truth. A map is always someone’s representation of the truth. A photograph is always a limited view of a true event but the crop limits the viewers experience, to the truth the photographer wants to share. Similarly earth is a sphere, but a cartographer’s drawings are flat and by design a lie. Despite this every map has an implied veracity.
