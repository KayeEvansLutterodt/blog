The moral code of a Cyclist 

Imagine running five miles with 15 lb of metal, this metal could really slow you down. Now reframe the situation, suppose that the 15 lb of metal is a bike? Now you can move faster than the fastest runner now the metal that was a burden is an your asset. 
I believe in the value of people, believe in incremental growth earned and cultivated by friction. Friction is good it shapes us and makes us better. I have a duty to be shaped in to something better everyday and a duty to be available to help shape those around me. I am a cyclist, ethical decision-making is like climbing hills an exercise conquered by practice propelled by my burdens and there is always a bigger hill tomorrow.

I am a cyclist my burdens are my assets I help people find ways to use their burdens to propel them to the next hill. <br />
